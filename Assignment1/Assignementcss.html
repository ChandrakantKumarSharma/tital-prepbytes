        <p> When compaaring CSS class vs ID, the different is the CSS class Applied a class muliple elemtents.ID on the other hand, applies a style to one unique elemtent. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to elemtentand it's used by JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In Css, sectors are used to targets a specific elements or range elements on web pages. once an elements has been targeted, a style or set style can be applied to the elemtent. </p>
        <p>
            there is a wide range of sector availabel. two most commanely used are class and ID. both are used in targets elements to which style should be applied.
